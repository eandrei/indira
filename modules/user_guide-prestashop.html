					<div>This option can only be used when an asset is selected, otherwise it should be set to "Overall".</div>
					<div><u>Options (Shipping)</u></div>
					<div class="desc3">Overall: The shipping discount is given if any of the products from the product list are in the cart.  If no product is selected, then it is assumed all the products are valid </div>
					<div class="desc3">Specific: The shipping discount is given if all the products in the cart are also in the coupon's product list. </div>
					<div><u>Options (Everything Else)</u></div>

				<div class="desc3">
					<div>Not used with gift certificates or function type 2 of shipping.</div>
					<u>Defined input</u>: this field is used instead of the value field if you want to create progressive coupons.  Progressive coupons are coupons that are based on the number of products customers buy.  For example, you could have a progressive coupon that says if a customer buys 1 item, then give him/her a 10% discount.  But if the customer buys 2 items then give him/her a 20% discount... etc etc. Using the example just mentioned, the input would look like 1-10;2-20;.  You can also set the maximum number of products that get a percent off.  Using the same example, lets say you want to give a 20% discount up to 10 items and then no more discounts.  This can be done with the following value: 1-10;2-20;11-0;.  The input field is very specific.  As a definition this can be broken down to [quantity]-[value];[quantity]-[value];...etc etc.
					<br><br>By default the product count is done on all products selected.  For example if you have products A, B, and C, then 2 A's are treated the same as 1 A and 1 B, in terms of the count.  By clicking the checkbox 'Apply Distinct Count', then 2 A's are treated as 1 product while 1 A and 1 B are treated as 2 products.

If the code is not found, then the Prestashop Coupon process is called.  AwoCoupon takes precedence over the store Coupon.  If the code exists within AwoCoupon (no matter if it is published or not), then the code is processed through the AwoCoupon system.  Also note that codes processed through the Prestashop Coupon System will be limited to the flexibility of Prestashop Coupons.

Instead of displaying the default message, you can change it to a more appropriate text such as "Please Login to use this coupon". To do this, click in the error display box, type your message and press the save button.

Since the discount type is set to specific, the percentage discount only applies to the products listed in the coupon.  If a customer has 1 of any of the 3 products, he/she would get no discount.  If the customer has 2 of any of the 3 products, a discount of 10% will be given for the 2 products.  If the customer has 5 (total quantity) of any of the 3 products, a discount of 20% will be given for the 5 products.  And lastly if the customer has 7 or more of the 3 products, a discount of 25% will be given on the 7 or more products.  Each of the customers selected can use this coupon a total of 3 times.  Since it has no expiration date, it never expires, but with the restrictions set, it effectively expires after all 7 customers use the coupon on 3 seperate occasions each.

<div class="title" id="Troubleshooting">5 Troubleshooting</div>
<div class="desc">If you are having problems with coupons being accepted, there are a few things you can try:
	<ul>
		<li>Go to AwoCoupon->Configuration->Error tab and change the error messages to something more identifiable, to see why a coupon fails.</li>
		<li>FTP into your webroot and verify these files are within your override folder:
			<ul>
				<li>/override/classes/Cart.php</li>
				<li>/override/classes/Order.php</li>
				<li>/override/classes/Discount.php</li>
				<li>/override/controllers/ParentOrderController.php</li>
			</ul>
			These files would have been added when you first installed AwoCoupon.  If you already had these override files, your originals were saved with the postfix .awocoupon.php.  You will need to merge the files in order to get your original function back.
